# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. You can play it in your terminal/console.

## Rules of the Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a two-player game where the objective is to get three of your symbols ('X' or 'O') in a row, column, or diagonal on the 3x3 grid.

- Player 'X' goes first.
- Players take turns marking an empty cell on the grid.
- The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins.
- If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a tie.
